## Project Abstract

Snake is a game where the purpose is for the player to maneuver a line that grows in length.

### How Does The Game Work? 

The snake will always start at the center of the board, moving up. The snake moves at a constant speed and can only move in four directions: Up, Down, Left, and Right. The arrow keys by the player control the movement of the snake. The snake grows by eating "apples." These apples appear at random times, lasting a random amount of time. This time interval is typically long enough for the snake to get to the apple. There can only be one apple that appears at a time. When the snake runs into the apple or "eats" the apple, it gets longer. The game continues until the snake dies. The snake dies in two ways: running into the edge of the board and running into its tail. The score at the end of the game is based on how many apples have been eaten. The game continuously gets more challenging as the snake gets bigger.

 ### Goal Of The Game: 
The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as the snake can before dying. Remember, the snake gradually gets longer the more apples it consumes, so you have to be careful not to hit its tail!

## Background

_BUILDING_

```
    - This project will be using Java, but if comfortable, you can use Python
    - I also ran this code using IntelliJ, probably can use any other idle as long as they are compatible with GitHub 
    - Need to make sure you have the most up to data JDK if writing in Java 
    - This source code is also using a .jar file, so make sure you have the most up-to-date one 
                            https://github.com/renanpvaz/java-snake/releases

```

_RUNNING_

```
    - To run this, you need to clone the GitHub repository
    - Once cloned, you need to ensure you are in the folder where the .jar file is located. If not, it won't be able to run 
    - Once you change your directory and are in the correct folder, in the terminal, type this command 
                                    
                                    java -jar snake.jar 
                                    
    - Once you hit enter, the snake game should come up, and you will be able to play.

## Downloading and Running

1. In case you don't have it already, download and install the [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

2. Download the .jar file from the latest [release](https://github.com/renanpvaz/java-snake/releases).

3. Inside the folder where the downloaded .jar is run:

```
java -jar snake.jar
```
