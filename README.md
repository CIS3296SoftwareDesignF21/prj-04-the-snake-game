## Project Abstract

Snake is a game where the purpose is for the player to maneuver a line that grows in length.

### How Does The Game Work? 

The snake will always start at the center of the board, moving up. The snake moves at a constant speed and can only move in four directions: Up, Down, Left, and Right. The arrow keys by the player control the movement of the snake. The snake grows by eating "apples." These apples appear at random times, lasting a random amount of time. This time interval is typically long enough for the snake to get to the apple. There can only be one apple that appears at a time. When the snake runs into the apple or "eats" the apple, it gets longer. The game continues until the snake dies. The snake dies in two ways: running into the edge of the board and running into its tail. The score at the end of the game is based on how many apples have been eaten. The game continuously gets more challenging as the snake gets bigger.

 ### Goal Of The Game: 
The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as the snake can before dying. Remember, the snake gradually gets longer the more apples it consumes, so you have to be careful not to hit its tail!

## Background

_BUILDING_

```
    - Need to make sure you have the most up to data JDK
    - This source code is also using a .jar file, so make sure you have the most up-to-date one 
                            https://github.com/renanpvaz/java-snake/releases

```

_RUNNING_

```
    - To run this, you need to clone the GitHub repository
    - Once cloned, you need to ensure you are in the folder where the .jar file is located. If not, it won't be able to run 
    - Once you change your directory and are in the correct folder, in the terminal, type this command 
                                    
                                    java -jar snake.jar 
                                    
    - Once you hit enter, the snake game should come up, and you will be able to play.

## Downloading and Running

1. In case you don't have it already, download and install the [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

2. Download the .jar file from the latest [release](https://github.com/renanpvaz/java-snake/releases).

3. Inside the folder where the downloaded .jar is run:

```
java -jar snake.jar
```

## New Ideas to the Game 

 1. Implement the game using threads: the direction of the snake and testing for collisions.  
 2. Crete a Test Model class for the game itself. Thinging about using Junit testing. This is to keep track of the high scores. 
 3. Add obstacles that pop up to kill the snake. Now the snake can die in three ways. Hitting a wall, hitting its own tail, or hitting this obstacle. 
 4. Adding a face to the snake. This will help see the snake better at what end its eatting the apple. 
 5. Increasing the speed of the snake. As the snake eats more apples the snake will increase the speed making the game harder as you go on. 
 6. Provide a scoreboard at the end of the game. 
 7. Change the menu screen when the game finishes to re-start the game. 
 8. Adding keys to pause, restart, or resume the game. 
 9. Adding tokens the snake can eat to give it extra lives. The total lives you can get is three. This allows you to keep playing the same game even when the         snake died. 
 10. Implements different modes to the game. The player can choose between beginner, intermediate, or expert.
 11. Implements different tokens in the game. One to slow down the snake for a period of time, one to go fast and nothing will kill it, etc.

Sean, College Student

Sean, age 21, is a college student (Senior) at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. He majors in 
Graphic Design at The Tyler School of Art where he uses his creativity to create and design interesting 
visual concepts using computer software. He was raised in a small town where him and his group of friends 
played a lot of video games together growing up to pass the time.

Seanâ€™s experience throughout his education of graphic design means he is interested in looking into 
creative and fun technology/games. His passion and love of video games also keeps him interested in exploring 
new types of online games which are visually pleasing yet also challenging due to his large amount of knowledge 
of video games. He will use the snake game to challenge himself to harder gameplay with the new upgrades that
have been implemented to the classic game; As well as enjoy the visually pleasing aesthetics that have been added.
