Betty, a mom with kids   
        
 </div> 
 
 
Betty is a woman, 40, with kids. She is somewhat experienced with technology but does not want to use a gaming console/controllers because she believes they are too complicated. She knows her kids enjoy playing video games but the ones they play are too overstimulating with their colorful interfaces and complicated gameplay. She feels that playing a new version of a game she liked previously will connect her with technology, as well as feel connected with her kids.  
  
Betty is looking to play a retro game with a new feel. She remembers playing earlier versions of the Snake game but wants to explore a newer version. Older versions of the game had only one speed of the game with only two ways to die: either running into the wall or running into itself. This new version of the game will include an easy interface to interact with and added obstacles to make the game increasingly difficult. The controls for the game are only the arrow keys plus some keys to access the menu options so this will be perfect for her needs.
